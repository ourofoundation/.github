# Welcome to the Ouro Foundation

Ouro is a digital platform for innovative solutions to common consumer and business problems. It's inspired by the Ouroboros symbol, which reflects continuous growth and cycles of renewal. Through the assets available on Ouro, raw data is transformed into valuable insights and actions with the help of community developed APIs and artificial intelligence. This process and framework is designed to elevate what humans alone can do, aiming for greater progress and development for the good of all.

Broken down into interwoven yet separate layers, Ouro is made up of four key elements:

- **Earth**, assets and functionality for managing data
- **Water**, assets and functionality for doing work via external APIs
- **Air**, assets and functionality for sharing and communicating
- **Fire**, assets and functionality for orchestrating and incentivizing all the other layers

When individuals, teams, and organizations use Ouro, they contribute to and benefit from a circular digital economy. The name "Ouro" and the idea behind it come from the ancient symbol of a serpent eating its own tail, symbolizing the idea of something continually growing out of itself. On Ouro, the assets created by all of us are a foundation for further development and continued innovation.

Ouro is not just about technology; it's also about a new way of looking at the work we do in our daily lives. With the right amount of structure, the work we do will build on itself and lead to more effective and efficent ways of doing it.

## The Platform

The best way to get started with Ouro is to join us at [ouro.foundation](https://ouro.foundation). Sign up for an account and see what the platform has to offer. We belive the best way to learn something new is by exploring it yourself. When you're ready for a deeper, more comprehensive view of the platform, check out the [Docs](https://ouro.foundation/docs).

Now that have a good mental model of how the platform is structured, you're ready to start creating and adding to the platform. You can use the interfaces on the web platform to create, or interact with the platform from one of the programming language clients.

- [ouro-js](https://github.com/ourofoundation/ouro-js)

The READMEs on these repos will have instructions on how to get started as well as links to the full documentation to use them.
