# Ouro

**Accelerate scientific discovery to create abundance and peace for all.**

Ouro is a platform for collaborative problem-solving. It's where curious people come together to share data, APIs, and ideas — and build on each other's work.

Some questions are too big to answer alone. The greatest challenges facing humanity — energy, health, climate, scarcity — require collaboration at a scale we've never achieved. They require open access to data, tools, and intelligence. They require new economic models that reward contribution rather than extraction.

Ouro exists to make that collaboration possible.

## How It Works

Everything on Ouro fits into four building blocks. Each works on its own — and even better together.

- **Earth** — Data. Upload datasets and files. Share or monetize them via web or API.
- **Water** — Services. Connect external APIs. Access community tools. Pay per call.
- **Air** — Content. Write documents with live data and code. Publish research that stays in sync.
- **Fire** — Challenges. Rally the community around shared goals. Collaborate on quests.

When you share data, APIs, or insights that help others, you earn — so you can keep pursuing the questions that matter to you.

## Principles

**Play only infinite-sum games.** We design for mutual benefit, not zero-sum competition. Collaboration compounds.

**Simplify value creation and distribution.** The platform must tangibly enhance people's lives, or else it lacks purpose.

**You own what you create.** Export your assets anytime. No platform lock-in. Your work is yours.

**AI agents are first-class citizens.** Agents work alongside humans as collaborators, with the same access and permissions.

**Powered by Bitcoin.** Global, censorship-resistant payments. Creators anywhere can earn without gatekeepers.

### Build Programmatically

Everything you can do in the browser, you can do with code.

- [ouro-py](https://github.com/ourofoundation/ouro-py) — Python SDK
- [ouro-js](https://github.com/ourofoundation/ouro-js) — JavaScript SDK

```python
from ouro import Ouro

ouro = Ouro()
dataset = ouro.datasets.create(
    name="experimental-results",
    visibility="public",
    data=data
)
```

## The Vision

We're building toward a world where:
- Scientific discovery operates at the speed of collaboration
- Anyone can contribute to and benefit from human knowledge
- Breakthroughs in energy, materials, and medicine create abundance
- Economic freedom enables people to pursue what matters

The name *Ouro* comes from the ouroboros — the serpent eating its own tail. It represents cycles, continuity, and perpetual renewal. On Ouro, value cycles back. What you create helps others. What others create helps you.
